The Weired Gaming Platform

Weired is a platform where players can sign in, creates maps from different games that they like, and then share them with their friends to play.

When the player signs in, he finds different maps from all the different games. These maps are designed by many people, like his friends or whatever.

He could also go ahead and design a map himself. He goes to a menu that shows him a list of supported games, he chooses one, and is sent to a designer menu where he could design his menu.

Now, there are a ton of challenges in here:

1- How are we going to support these games??? First of all, we need collaboration from the game developer himself. Also, some part of the game engine will have to be included in order to be able to play the game, so what can we do????

Remember, always start with an MVP, we don't really need to support everything, just some basic thing

Start with TiltMazes
